# Command-Line-Forensics-Project
For this project I utilized the command line to extract specific file data on user profiles and move that file data to a new location. 
I was given given a zip file (OrderRecords.zip) filled with Order and Inventory Records from 2012–2017. 
My task was to create and run a shell script to complete the following:
   Create a folder called AllRecords. 
   Copy all of the order records from 2012–2017 into the AllRecords folder. 
   Inside of the AllRecords folder, create a folder called VIPCustomerOrders.
   Find all orders from the VIP Customers Michael Davis or Michael Campbell. Include line and file names in the output.
   Move these specific files into the VIPCustomerOrders folder in the form of two files: michael_campbell_orders.output and michael_davis_orders.output.
   Create a file called VIPCustomerDetails.md that details how many orders each of the two users made. 
I found this project to very quite fun and very useful. 
Utilizing grep to a large extent was satisfying when the script opererated as it should.
